# Comparing Writing Style
## Overview
This a program created using Bash, Awk, Sed, and other Unix tools to analyze and compare the writing style of text files. The program will calculate various metrics to quantify the linguistic features that contribute to an author's style. The top-level script for this program is named "style_cmp".
## Input
- The program reads one or two text files for analysis.
- If one file is specified, the program creates and prints out a profile for that file.
- If two files are specified, the program creates profiles for each file and compares them using a metric. The program should then output the distance score, which reflects the dissimilarity between the two texts' writing styles. A low score implies that the same author is likely responsible for both texts, while a large score implies different authors.

The examples and sample profiles provided can serve as references for creating and comparing profiles.
